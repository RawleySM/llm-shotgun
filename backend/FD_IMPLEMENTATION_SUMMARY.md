## FD 11: Administrative Controls

**Service**: `app/services/admin.py`
**Routes**: `app/routes/admin.py`, enhanced `app/routes/health.py`

### Implemented Features:
- **11.1 Enhanced Health Endpoint**: Comprehensive system status with all services
- **11.2 Request Metadata**: Detailed request and token information retrieval
- **11.3 Provider Controls**: Enable/disable individual LLM providers

### API Endpoints:

#### Health & Monitoring:
- `GET /api/health` - Enhanced health status with all FD services
- `GET /api/metrics` - Prometheus-style metrics
- `GET /api/admin/system/status` - Comprehensive system status

#### Request Management:
- `GET /api/admin/requests/{request_id}` - Request metadata and token information

#### Provider Management:
- `POST /api/admin/providers/{provider_name}/enable` - Enable provider
- `POST /api/admin/providers/{provider_name}/disable` - Disable provider

#### Maintenance Operations:
- `POST /api/admin/maintenance/prune` - Manual data pruning
- `POST /api/admin/maintenance/backup` - Manual backup creation
- `GET /api/admin/maintenance/backups` - List available backups
- `POST /api/admin/maintenance/restore/{backup_filename}` - Database restoration

### Enhanced Health Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T00:00:00Z",
  "providers": {"openai": "closed", "anthropic": "half-open"},
  "database": {"connected": true, "last_check": "2025-01-06T00:00:00Z"},
  "metrics": {
    "requests": {"total": 1234, "last_24h": 45, "completed": 1200},
    "tokens": {"total": 87543},
    "providers": {"openai": {"attempt_count": 500, "avg_duration_seconds": 2.3}}
  },
  "services": {
    "consistency": {"token_gaps_detected": false},
    "retention": {"wal_file_size": 2048, "backup_count": 5},
    "backup": {"last_backup_time": "2025-01-05T03:00:00Z"},
    "shutdown": {"shutdown_initiated": false}
  }
}
```

- **`llm_requests`**: Request metadata and status
- **`llm_attempts`**: Individual provider attempts per request
- **`llm_token_log`**: Streaming token persistence with timestamps
- **`provider_status`**: Circuit breaker status and provider management

### Indexes:
- Optimized for token gap detection queries
- Performance indexes for retention operations
- Provider status lookups
- Time-based indexes for pruning operations

## Deployment Notes

1. **Cron Scripts**: Copy to appropriate cron directories in Docker container
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
3. **Directory Creation**: All necessary directories created automatically
4. **Database Migration**: Run automatically during application startup
5. **Health Monitoring**: Enhanced `/api/health` endpoint provides comprehensive status

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready foundation for the LLM Service Layer with comprehensive administrative controls, automated maintenance, and reliable data persistence.
